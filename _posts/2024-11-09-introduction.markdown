## Fitness vs. Health: A Journey Towards Balance

You might’ve taken a New Year’s resolution, want to impress someone, or simply decided to get fit and put on some muscle. Whatever your reason, kudos to you!

Before you start, let's clarify the difference between *fitness* and *health*. It may surprise some to learn that these two words don’t mean the same thing.

**Health** is the overall well-being of an individual, encompassing both mental and physical aspects.  
**Fitness** is the ability to perform specific mental or physical tasks effectively.

Simply put, being healthy doesn’t necessarily mean you're fit, and being fit doesn’t mean you're healthy. There’s a difference, and recognizing it is key.

Many people idolize bodybuilders and Mr. Olympia contestants, but they often overlook the toll these extreme pursuits can take on health. Don’t get me wrong. I'm not saying don’t admire them. Rather, don’t idolize anyone blindly. Work on yourself, set goals that fit your needs, and if you choose to look up to someone, do so in a way that serves your growth.  

**Most of you starting this journey will fail at some point. No matter what you do.**  
I’ve failed countless times myself. The key is getting back up and trying again.

Before we dive into the topic, a quick intro: My name is Aasish Raj, and I’m a 20-year-old in my fourth year of Computer Science Engineering at a college in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. I try to take good care of my health, although I could improve my sleep (I’m juggling an internship and side gigs). I come from an upper-middle-class family in a village, with parents who believe whey protein is a drug, a misconception common among many Indians.

When it comes to health and fitness, I’m heavily inspired by Bryan Johnson, the guy trying to outlive the solar system.

Enough yapping. Let’s get into the topic!

I'll focus on **physical health and fitness** in this blog.

Everything I share here is based on my experiences and opinions. Take it with a pinch of salt.

## The Three Pillars of Fitness

I like to classify the fitness journey into three core areas:

### 1. Diet and Nutrition

This is the foundation of any fitness journey.  
The saying "You are what you feed your mind" applies to your body too."You are what you eat."

> *A good diet can make up for a bad workout session.*  

I wouldn’t say I follow a strict diet, though many of my friends tell me to relax and “enjoy life.” For me, though, a balanced, healthy diet *is* enjoying life. It’s unfortunate that in today's world, unhealthy eating is often equated with living fully.

I don't publish my diet because I’ve consulted dietitians to get it tailored for me. I update it every six months to adapt to my needs, but yes, eating healthy in India is expensive.

Traditional Indian diets focus heavily on carbohydrates, a result of our genetic adaptation to historical famines and food shortages. Coupled with a largely sedentary lifestyle and the lack of fitness culture in many Indian households, this has led to an epidemic of "skinny fat" (people with low muscle mass but high fat levels).

Taking control of what your body uses as fuel helps shape your body.

I’ll explore cost-effective ways to make nutritious diets more affordable in future posts.

### 2. Physical Exertion

Humans are incredibly capable work engines, and our bodies can achieve amazing feats with the right training.

My exercise routine is more focused on strength training than on bodybuilding. That’s just my preference, but it’s **not wrong** to work out for aesthetics. Most people start their fitness journey wanting to look good. And that’s perfectly valid.

However, certain genetic factors can make it challenging for Indian men to achieve the "X frame" body shape often idolized in bodybuilding.
Indian women often face societal discouragement when it comes to strength training. Instead, many are encouraged to gain weight to appear "healthy," reflecting a cultural misunderstanding of fitness.

In essence, physical exercise is about pushing your muscles and causing tiny tears in the fibers (don’t worry, it’s normal). The body repairs and strengthens these fibers, resulting in muscle growth and increased strength.

### 3. Mental Resilience

Often overlooked, mental toughness is as important as physical training.  
Even if your body is capable, a weak mind can prevent you from reaching your goals. For instance, why don’t we always get enough steps in a day? The answer, more often than not, is laziness.  

Mental resilience can be trained, just like muscles. The ability to stick to a healthy diet is tough, especially when your mind tells you, “What’s the harm in one donut?” It’s not that you can’t have treats, but you should weigh the pros and cons mindfully. How does eating that donut make you feel? Does it affect your performance later? I’ve learned to ask myself these questions before making dietary choices.

You don’t have to go to extremes. Small, consistent efforts can lead to big changes. I’m still working on my own mental health, so I’m sharing only from my experience here.

## Conclusion

This is just an introduction to help you get started on your health and fitness journey. I hope you stick with it and achieve your goals.

### Key Takeaway

**Your physical body is a tool for your mind. The sharper and stronger the tool, the more amazing things you can accomplish with it.**
